# HalfStepper

#### An Arduino library to enable half-stepping and single/dual phasing for step motors.
---

HalfStepper decorates (wraps) the Stepper library to provide half-step states and has options for single/dual phasing as well as multiple coil sequencing options.
<br/>
<br/>This library is able to drive motors directly or through drivers with motor control or H-bridge chips, such as the L293, L298, and L9110.
